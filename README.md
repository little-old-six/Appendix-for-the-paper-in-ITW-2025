# Appendix for the paper in ITW-2025

This is the appendix for the paper: Improved Successive Cancellation Decoding of Polar Codes Through Perturbing A Posteriori LLRs.

Due to page limitations, we had to remove the appendix from our manuscript in the 2025 Information Theory Workshop (ITW). The appendix contains all the proofs of the Theorems and Corollaries. If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me at ieee dot org. 

In addition, code will be released soon.
